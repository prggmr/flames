A Django inspired ORM for PHP that doesn't suck!

This project is still highly experimental and using it for anything you or 
anyone else cares about is really living on the edge.

## Installation

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org)


Include the following in your ```composer.json``` file.

    {
        "require": {
            "prggmr/flames": "0.*.*"
        }
    }

Run the installer.

    php composer.phar install

## Intentions

Have an ORM that isn't 30,000 files and doesn't do some weird voodoo magic
behind the scenes to make my SQL queries run.

## Experimental

I can't say this enough ... just don't use this library unless you like to cut
yourself and bleed!
